        p Datamasters of the same prototype are kept in sync. This allows multiple users to access the same data at the same time. This means you can build chatrooms, synced to-do lists etc. This also means that for the data sync to work, you have to store everything in datamasters.
        p Information put into the Datamasters in JIM will be present in every instance created. So if you want them all to have some default data, add it to the initial prototype.
        p Different prototypes have separate information, so if you want to upload the same prototype with different data, just make a new prototype.
        p There are a few specific commands that you can use:
        p Create an input field. As it’s name, type:
        p ‘service-time-interval-x’ to trigger on Change events of the input field every x milliseconds. For example ‘service-time-interval-1000’ will make the on Change events trigger every second.
        p ‘service-datamaster-change’ to change the value of the field every time a datamaster changes to the datamaster name that was changed and trigger on Change event of the input field itself.--></div><!--footer.lp.container
